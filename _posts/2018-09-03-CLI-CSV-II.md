# Summary

Sometimes it can be useful to manipulate a csv file in the tergminal, and some times you need to do more than listed in [part one](http://fj9.github.io/awk/2016/11/30/CLI-CSV.html). 

## Changing Seperator: CSV to Tab
This can easily be done by using tr, however this will run into problems if there are tabs in the text of a column.
```bash
tr '\t' ',' < input.tsv > output.csv
```
* ```tr``` translate function
* ```'\t'``` the character we wish to replace 
* ```','``` what we want to replacw it with
* ```< input.tsv >``` the name of the input file
* ```>``` directs the output of the operation to a file
* ```output.csv``` the name of the new file that will contain the output

## Changing Column Order
In order to do this it can be useful to print a list of column names and there index
```bash
head -1 input.tsv | tr '\t' '\n' | tr -d " " | awk '{print NR,$0}'
```
* ```head``` function that outputs the begining of a file
* ```-1``` the number of lines to print
* ```|``` pipe the ouput of the first operation to the next
* ```tr '\t' '\n'``` as above we use the translate function to replace the tabs with new lines
* ```tr -d " "``` this uses the translate function to delete whitespace, note this also deletes spaces that might be in the column headers
* ```awk``` is a pattern scanning and processing language
* ```'{print NR,$0}'``` print the total number of input records seen so far (this will be the column number) then print the column title. AWK splits the input into input records be new line characters. Each record is then split into fields, in this case we only have one field so will print this by printing the first field using $0.

###Reordering
This can be done simply with an awk script. 
```bash
awk -F\t '{print $1,$7,$9,$31,$32,$13}' OFS="\t" "original.tsv" > output.tsv

* ```awk``` is a pattern scanning and processing language
* ```-F\t``` the -F option is used to deifine what character we want to use as a field seperator in this case tab \t
* ```'{print``` telling awk to print output
* ```$1, $7``` we are telling awk which fields to output in which order
* ```OFS="\t"``` the output field seperator this is what the fields specified in the print statement will be seperated with
* ```"orginal.tsv" the name of the file we wish to process
* ``` > ouput.tsv``` direct the standard output to a new file 
```
This script can be used to add columns with a defulat value
```bash
awk -F\t '{print $1,N,$7,$9,$31,$32,$13}' OFS="\t" "original.tsv" > output.tsv
```

* ```'{print $1, N``` tells awk to print column 1 then adds in another column with N in every row

## Removing Empty Rows
This can be done easily using awk, so I will also show you how to chain together awk commands. Chaining commands like this can 
```bash 
awk -F\t '{print $22 }' "orignal.csv" | awk 'NF' > output.csv
```

* ```awk -F\t '{print $22}' "original.csv``` tells awk to print column 22 from the tab deliminted file original.csv
* ```|``` This is a pipe and directs the output from the operation on the left to the operation on the right
* ```awk 'NF'``` NF is a set command in awk, NF variable holds the number of fields in the record. awk script follows the syntax condition {statement}. In this case the condition is true if it is not equal to zero. The statement block is empty so awk will print the whole record where the condition is true..



## Concatonating Colmumns

```bash
awk -F\t '{b=$2";"$3; print $1, b}' OFS="\t"  "original.csv" > output.csv
```

* ```b=$2";"$3``` tells awk to print column 2 and 3 concatonated with a ;
