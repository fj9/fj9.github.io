#Sorting

There are many different sorting algorithms and they each have different use caases.  For Example quick sort is really fast for sorting a rndom list but becomes very slow for an already sorted list.   If you know you need to sort a list that is almost sorted then bubble sort will probably be more apprioate.  However bubble sort opperates much worse on random data than quick sort.
