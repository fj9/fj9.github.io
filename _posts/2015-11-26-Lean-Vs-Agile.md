#What is Lean, what is Agile are they different?

This question came up on a Lean Coffee meetup that I attended this morning.

##Lean
Lean Development is about choosing what to build and building it efficiently.  A Lean approach encourages you to build only what you need. Lean encourages working in an efficient manner.  

A Lean Coffee meeting format is considered Lean as it eliminates some common inefficiencies of meetings, such as talking about things no one needs to talk about for longer than they need to talk about it.

##Agile
Agile is a reaction and proposed solution to the inefficiency of heavyweight methodologies.  These heavyweight methodologies can lead to the sort of inefficiencies that Lean also tries to address.  Agile gives some values and principles which should help you to eliminate inefficiencies.

##Common Agile Practices

###Management
Scrum and Kanban are management practices that agile teams often use to manage the cycle or flow of work.

###Development
Extreme Programming (XP), Test Driven Design (TDD), Behaviour Driven Design (BDD), Continuous Delivery are technical practices used by the team to reduce the cycle time to improve feedback loops to help eliminate inefficiencies. 

##Summary
**Agile** can be seen as a way of implementing Lean principles in software development. 

###Or

**Lean** can be a way to justify Agile methodologies to external parties.
